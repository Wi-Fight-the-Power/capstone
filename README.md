# Overview

Sketchi allows you to create rooms to play with friends, and offers real time communication with an in-game chat feature. While we can't guarantee it won't get competitive, you'll be able to have back and forth banter with all involved.

# What Sketchi Offers:

Easy to understand gameplay: With or without our instructions, it'll only take 1 round to figure out how everything works, and that's when things get Sketchi!

Everyone can score: That's right! Even as the drawer, you can earn points if everyone else is able to figure out what you're drawing!

Flexibility: If you think your current word is Sketchi, simply shuffle and select another to draw, but be careful as the clock is ticking!

Be creative: With drawing features such as colors, board colors and line size, you can go full Da Vinci (in 90 seconds)!

Easy lobby access: Creating a lobby and providing friends with the room code takes no time at all, and you can create unique usernames without the hassle of email confirmation!
